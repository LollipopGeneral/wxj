- Some emojis were imported from momo.snh48live.org, which I collected along the way;
- Most emojis were extracted from `Weibo intl. 2.6.7.ipa` using [this script](https://gist.github.com/zmwangx/f000d992ae2099c470b8ec98bc87b37a) (one can also extract from `Weibo.app/Emoticons.bundle` inside the regular `Weibo.ipa`, but the international version contains more);
- Some old emojis were extracted from [`data/emojis.json` in `dudubaby/source.dudubaby.org`](https://github.com/dudubaby/source.dudubaby.org/blob/master/data/emojis.json); note that in some cases I deliberately replaced old-style emojis with new-style ones for consistency.
